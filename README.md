# SWA-VAE

In this repository we explore how stochastic weight averaging (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407) can be implemented for (Variational) Auto-Encoder. 

For experiments with a regular autoencoder see autoencoder_demos.py.

In vae_failure_demo.py, vae_encoder_demo.py, and vae_dencoder_demo.py we experiment with VAEs.
